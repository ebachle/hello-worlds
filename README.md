# Hello Worlds

This is a collection of assorted "hello world" style examples for assorted little projects. They're usually in an attempt to prove out a piece of technology holistically but not completely.

I'll often have a `./scripts` directory in each project to help automate dependency installation, spin up, and spin down.

YMMV, yada yada
